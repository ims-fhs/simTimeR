Description: simTimeR provides functions to coerce DateTimes to integer
        numbers (called simDateTime). The integer number represents
        seconds starting from 01.01.2014, 00:00:00. Also provides
        functions to access only the day of a simDateTime (as integer
        between 0 and 364) or only the time of a simDateTime (as
        integer between 0 and 24*60*60-1) or only the weekday as String
        (Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa, So)
