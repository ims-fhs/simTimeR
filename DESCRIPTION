Description: schedule provides functions to coerce datetimes to integer
        numbers (called simdatetime). The integer number represents
        seconds starting from 01.01.2014, 00:00:00. Also provides
        functions to access only the day of a simdatetime (as integer
        between 0 and 364) or only the time of a simdatetime (as
        integer between 0 and 24*60*60-1) or only the weekday as string
        (Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun)
