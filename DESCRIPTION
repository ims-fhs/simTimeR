Description: simTimeR provides functions to coerce DateTimes to integer numbers (called simDateTime). The integer number represents seconds starting from 01.01.2014, 00:00:00. Also provides functions to access only the day of a simDateTime (as integer between 0 and 364) or only the time of a simDateTime (as integer between 0 and 24*60*60-1) or only the weekday as String (Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa, So)
