## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. 

In this version I have:  

* Included a reference to Discrete-Event Simulation, the application of simtimer.
* More clearly stated how simtimer calculates the relative timescale using as.numeric().
* Renamed functions for a better understanding between objects of the relative timescale (called sim_datetimes) and functions to transform from datetime to sim_datetime and back (now called as.sim_datetime() and as.datetime()).

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.4.3
* local OS X 10.11.6 install, R 3.3.0

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
