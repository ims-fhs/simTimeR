Simtimer is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times on a relative 
timescale referring to an `origin_date` by choice. It is based on the lubridate package. 
  
The applications of simtimer are tasks (i.e. simulation) including a timerange of several 
minutes to years. For such problems, the time dimension might preferably be represented as a relative timescale
(integer) than a series of `date-time` objects (POSIXt). Simtimer is an basic tool
to transform `date-times` to a relative timescale in seconds (`sim_datetime`) and vice versa. Additionally
simtimer allows to extract elements of a `sim_datetime` such as second, weekday and day.  

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "690px"}
knitr::include_graphics("comparison_simtimer_vs_regular_time.png")
```


## Basic transformation

For the transofrmation into the relative timescale (`date-time` -> `sim_datetime`) use the 
corresponding function `sim_datetime()`. This function expects an `origin_date` of 
choice to be predefined. This `origin_date` should be earlier in time than the remaining 
`date-time`-elements.

```{r}
library(simtimer)
origin_date <- lubridate::ymd_hms("2017-01-01 00:00:00", tz = "UTC")
my_datetime <- c(lubridate::ymd_hms("2017-01-01 02:00:00", tz = "UTC"), 
                 lubridate::ymd_hms("2017-02-27 20:53:20", tz = "UTC"),
                 lubridate::ymd_hms("2017-08-20 11:33:20", tz = "UTC"),
                 lubridate::ymd_hms("2018-01-06 08:53:20", tz = "UTC"))
my_sim_datetime <- sim_datetime(my_datetime)
my_sim_datetime
class(my_sim_datetime)
```

All remaining functions of simtimer take a `sim_datetime` as an argument.  

For the opposite transformation (`sim_datetime` -> `date-time`) use the corresponding function
`datetime()`. As the `origin_date` is defined globally, it doesn't need to be defined
anymore. The expectation here is that the `origin_date` won't change during your calculations.

```{r}
datetime(my_sim_datetime)
```


## Extracting the second (of a day)

Similar to `lubridate::second()` you can extract the second of a `sim_datetime` elemet by using 
the function `sim_time()`. It returns how many seconds have past since the last "beginning of
a day" depending on the time-part of your `origin_date` ("00:00:00" is recommended).
```{r}
sim_time(my_sim_datetime)
```


## Extracting the weekday

Similar to `lubridate::wday()` you can extract the weekday of a `sim_datetime` elemet by using 
the function `sim_wday()`. It returns the actual weekday of your `sim_datetime`.
```{r}
sim_wday(my_sim_datetime)
```


## Extracting the day (since `origin_date`)

In order to count the days that have passed since the beginning (your `origin_date`) use 
`sim_date()`. To be more precise - the function returns the number of `24*60*60`-intervals 
that have passed since your `origin_date`.   

```{r}
sim_date(my_sim_datetime)
```
